# TWITTER USER ANALYSIS

This project is a analysis of tweets from three specific Twitter users: Trixie Mattel, Greta Thunberg, and Taylor Swift using information stored in JSON Files. I have created a function that will answer all project objectives for each file. Additional analysis was completed on Trixie Mattel's tweets including how many users have favorited her tweets and how many times she mentions Ru Paul's Drag Race. 

The final code file and raw JSON files can be found in this repo. 

## Project Objectives

1. How many times has the person been retweeted in total?

2. What is the average number of retweets the person has per tweet? 

3. How many statuses have quote status (`is_quote_status=True`)?
